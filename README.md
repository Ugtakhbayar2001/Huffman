# Huffman

In this project were going to explore a specific way to encode and decode text files (very large
Strings) into specific patterns of zeros and ones. We will start with the encoding process: turning
a String into a pattern of zeros and ones. Then we will explore the decoding process (turning a
sequence of zeros and ones into a string) We will do this by looking at Huffman coding schemes,
an interesting coding scheme that can sometimes substantially compress text files.

The HuffmanCodeBook class can encode text into a Huffman
code. This will represent the code tables â€“ a quick method to
translate from a letter to a specific binary sequence.

the HuffmanNode and HuffmanCodeTree classes allow us to
represent the huffman code tree
